# turbo

This is the NetBSD AMD64 binary for turbo, a monorepo build system. See https://github.com/vercel/turborepo for details.

⚠️ Note: NetBSD is not one of [Node's supported platforms](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform), so installing turbo may or may not work on NetBSD depending on how Node has been patched. This is not a problem with turbo. ⚠️
