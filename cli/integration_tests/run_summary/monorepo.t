# HACK: Generated run summaries are named with a ksuid, which is a time-sorted ID. This _generally_ works
# but we're seeing in this test that sometimes a summary file is not sorted (with /bin/ls) in the order we expect
# causing intermittent test failures. 
# Add a sleep statement so we can be sure that the second run is a later timestamp,
# so we can reliably get it with `|head -n1` and `|tail -n1` later in this test.
# When we start emitting the path to the run summary file that was generated, or a way to specify
# the output file, we can remove this and look for the file directly.
# If you find this sleep statement, try running this test 10 times in a row. If there are no
# failures, it *should* be safe to remove.
