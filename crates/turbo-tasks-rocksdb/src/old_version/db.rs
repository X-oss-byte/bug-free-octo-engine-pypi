// General:
// Data is split into global information and session specific information.
// For each different user intent type, a different session is used.
// e. g. `next dev` and `next build` would have different sessions, but
// multiple calls to `next dev` would use the same session.
// The activeness of tasks is stored session specific, so we don't need to
// switch active flags of many tasks when switching between sessions.
// We never want to update something in all session, since there could be
// a lot session.
// So a generation system is used to allow iterating over all tasks that have
// changed since the last usage of a sesssion. When opening a session we will
// bring the session up-to-date, when there were operations in other session
// in between.
// The global generation is increased when the first write operation happens
// after the database is opened.

// This stores the type and inputs of a task and maps it to a task id.
// Can't be changed.
