# Migrating from webpack to Turbopack

We're planning Turbopack as the successor to webpack. In the future, we plan to give Turbopack all the tools needed to support your webpack app.

Currently, migrating to Turbopack from webpack is **not yet possible**. In the future, we're planning to offer a smooth migration path for all webpack users to join the Turbopack future.

## Will it be compatible with webpack's API?

webpack has a huge API. It's extremely flexible and extensible, which is a big reason why it's so popular.

We're planning on making Turbopack very flexible and extensible, but we're **not planning 1:1 compatibility with webpack**. This lets us make choices which improve on webpack's API, and lets us optimize for speed and efficiency.

## Will we be able to use webpack plugins?

webpack plugins are a crucial part of webpack's ecosystem. They let you customize your toolchain, giving you low-level tools to maximize your productivity.

Since we're not offering 1:1 API compatibility, most webpack plugins won't work out of the box with Turbopack.

However, we're working on porting several of the most popular webpack plugins to Turbopack.
