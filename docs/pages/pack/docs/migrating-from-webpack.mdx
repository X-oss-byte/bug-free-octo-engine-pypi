# Migrating from webpack to Turbopack

<Callout type="info">
  Turbopack now implements basic webpack loader support and configuration familiar to webpack users
</Callout>

We're planning Turbopack as the successor to webpack. In the future, we plan to give Turbopack all the tools needed to support your webpack app.

Currently, Turbopack supports a subset of webpack's loader API and offers similar configuration aliasing module resolution. Note that using webpack-based Next.js plugins as-is from `next.config.js` is **not yet possible**.

## webpack loaders for Next.js

Firstly, Turbopack for Next.js does not require loaders nor loader configuration for built-in functionality, just as they aren't required for Next.js. There's no need for `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, or `babel-loader` if you're just using `@babel/preset-env`.

If you need loader support beyond what's built in, some webpack loaders, including [`@mdx-js/loader`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/loader/) already work with Turbopack! There are currently some limitations:

- At the moment, only a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. This is enough for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our support for this API in the future.
- Options passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.

At the moment, configuring webpack loaders is possible for Next.js apps through an experimental option in `next.config.js`. `turbo.loaders` can be set to a mapping of file extensions to a list of package names or `{loader, options}` pairs:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      loaders: {
        // Option format
        '.md': [
          {
            loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
            options: {
              format: 'md',
            },
          },
        ],
        // Option-less format
        '.mdx': '@mdx-js/loader',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Resolve aliases

Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      resolveAlias: {
        underscore: 'lodash',
        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This aliases imports of the `underscore` package to the `lodash` package. In other words, `import underscore from 'underscore'` will load the `lodash` module instead of `underscore`.

Turbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `mocha` module will be aliased to `mocha/browser-entry.js` when Turbopack targets browser environments.

## FAQ

### Which loaders are currently supported?

The following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:

- [`@mdx-js/loader`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/loader/) â€” note that plugin modules passed to `rehypePlugins` and `remarkPlugins` are not currently supported.
- [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)

### Will it be compatible with webpack's API?

webpack has a huge API. It's extremely flexible and extensible, which is a big reason why it's so popular.

We're planning on making Turbopack very flexible and extensible, but we're **not planning 1:1 compatibility with webpack**. This lets us make choices which improve on webpack's API, and lets us optimize for speed and efficiency.

### Will we be able to use webpack plugins?

webpack plugins are a crucial part of webpack's ecosystem. They let you customize your toolchain, giving you low-level tools to maximize your productivity.

Unlike loaders, webpack plugins can be tightly integrated with webpack's internals.

Since we're not offering 1:1 API compatibility for plugins, most won't work out of the box with Turbopack. However, we're working on porting several of the most popular webpack plugins to Turbopack.
