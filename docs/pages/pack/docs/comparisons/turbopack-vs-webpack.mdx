# Turbopack vs Webpack

We've built Turbopack as the successor of Webpack - the bundler that's at the heart of many beloved frameworks. Any successor to Webpack would need to be **faster** and just as **flexible and extensible**.

## Speed

Turbopack's incremental architecture outstrips Webpack's speed on several key metrics:

### Dev server startup time

Turbopack's dev server starts up much faster than Webpack. Next.js 12, which uses Webpack under the hood, can start up a build server on a 1,000 module application in <DocsBenchmarkStat stat="next12-cold-1000" />. Turbopack starts up in <DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-cold-1000" /> - **<DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-cold-vs-next12" /> faster**.

<DocsBenchmarksGraph category="cold" bars={[
  {
    label: 'Turbopack',
    turbo: true,
    key: 'next13'
  },
  {
    label: 'Webpack',
    key: 'next12',
  }
]} />

### Code updates

The most common action you'll perform on a dev server is changing files. When a file changes, it needs to render the change to the browser. The faster it can do that, the tighter your feedback loop and the faster you'll ship.

In a 1,000 module application, Turbopack can react to file changes **<DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-update-vs-next12" /> faster** than Webpack:

<DocsBenchmarksGraph category="file_change" bars={[
  {
    label: 'Turbopack',
    turbo: true,
    key: 'next13'
  },
  {
    label: 'Webpack',
    key: 'next12',
  }
]} />

## Extensibility

Webpack has an extraordinary collection of [plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins) to customize its behavior. Composing plugins lets you create custom toolchains which can support a huge variety of bundler features.

In its alpha state, Turbopack cannot currently be configured with plugins. In the future, we plan to make Turbopack just as extensible as Webpack - though likely with an altered API.
