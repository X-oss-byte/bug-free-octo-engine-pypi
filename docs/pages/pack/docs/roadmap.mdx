# Roadmap

We've got big plans for Turbopack. Here's what we're aiming for in the future:

## Next.js

### Short term

Our first target is an improved local development experience for Next.js to allow to enable a faster development iteration cycle.

- Reach parity with the existing Next.js dev server feature set, e. g.
  - [PostCSS](/pack/docs/features/css#postcss) and [Tailwind](/pack/docs/features/css#tailwind-css)
  - next/image, next/dynamic, @next/font, next/script
  - URL imports, `new URL()`, MDX
  - Streaming of React Server Components, `getStaticPaths`, 404 page, custom error page
  - Internationalization
- Support configuration from `next.config.js` and `jsconfig.json`
- Improve HMR experience for:
  - `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`
  - Server Components
  - `_app` and `_document`
  - `next.config.js`
- Add partial support for production builds
  - This doesn't include advanced optimizations like tree shaking and code splitting yet

### Mid term

Next, we'll aim to improve the performance of production builds.

- Reach parity with the existing `next build` feature set
- Port popular Next.js plugins to Turbopack

### Long term

Our long term vision is to bring Turbopack into the heart of Next.js.

- Make Turbopack the default for `next dev` and `next build`, falling back to webpack when a webpack configuration is detected in `next.config.js`
- Working with users and plugin authors to reduce blockers for Turbopack adoption

## Turbopack

### Short term

Our short term goal is to open Turbopack to other frameworks and bring the lessons we've learned from Next.js to all Turbopack powered frameworks.

- Move Next.js support into a framework plugin
  - Each framework should be an equal first-class citizen
- Move error overlay from Next.js to Turbopack
- Start adding support for more frameworks e. g. webpack, Svelte, Vue, Angular, etc.
  - Work with authors to achieve the best integration experience
- Offer a Turbopack configuration and plugin API for advanced usage outside of Next.js
  - Document how users can migrate from webpack to Turbopack
- Integrate existing tools for typechecking and linting

### Mid term

Our mid term goal is to make more builds incremental and to overhaul the in-browser UI and introspection capabilities to make available information more accessible.

- Add support for persistent caching on disk
  - This is also a requirement for `next build` support
- Improve error overlay
- Offer more in-browser dev tools

### Long term

Our long term vision are near-instant builds and a world-class developer experience.

- Add support for remote caching
  - Vercel remote cache
  - Self-hosted
- Further improve on observability and introspection
