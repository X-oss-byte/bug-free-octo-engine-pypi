# Benchmarks

To track our progress and validate our assumptions, we run benchmarks regularly on the Turbopack repo against Vite and previous versions of Next.js.

## Metrics

Let's break down exactly what each of these metrics mean, and how they'll impact your day-to-day developer experience.

### Cold startup time

This test measures how fast a dev server starts up on an application of various sizes.

<DocsBenchmarksGraph category="cold" bars={DEFAULT_BARS} />

To measure this, we run an end-to-end test which:

1. Generates an application with a set number of JS modules
1. Runs the dev server on `localhost:3000`
1. Visits `localhost:3000` in Chrome
1. Waits until the site has finished loading its last module.

### File updates

We also measure how quickly your dev server updates when a source file changes. This helps us get a sense for how fast your dev server will respond to updates.

<DocsBenchmarksGraph category="file_change" bars={DEFAULT_BARS} />

This uses a similar setup:

1. Generates an application with a set number of JS modules
1. Runs the dev server on `localhost:3000`
1. Visits `localhost:3000` in Chrome
1. Changes a module in the file system.
1. Waits until the site has finished loading the new module.
