# Development tasks in a Monorepo

The vast majority of development workflows look like this:

1. Open a repository
2. Run a `dev` task while they develop
3. At the end of the day, shut down the `dev` task and close the repository.

`dev` will likely be the most frequently run task in your repository, so getting it right is important.

## Types of `dev` tasks

`dev` tasks come in many shapes and sizes:

1. Running a local development server for a web app
1. Running [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to re-run a backend process every time code changes
1. Running tests in `--watch` mode

## Setup with Turborepo

You should specify your `dev` task like this in your `turbo.json`.

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

Since `dev` tasks don't produce outputs, `outputs` is empty. `dev` tasks are also unique in that you rarely want to [cache](/docs/core-concepts/caching) them, so we set `cache` as `false`.

### Setting up `package.json`

You should also provide a `dev` task in your root `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev"
  }
}
```

This enables developers to run the task directly from their normal task runner.

## Running tasks _before_ `dev`

In some workflows, you'll want to run tasks _before_ you run your `dev` task. For instance, generating code or running a `db:migrate` task.

In these cases, use [`dependsOn`](/docs/core-concepts/running-tasks#in-the-same-workspace) to say that any `codegen` or `db:migrate` tasks should be run _before_ `dev` is run.

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["codegen", "db:migrate"],
      "cache": false,
    },
    "codegen": {
      "outputs": ["./codegen-outputs/**"]
    },
    "db:migrate": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

Then, in your app's `package.json`:

```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // For example, starting the Next.js dev server
    "dev": "next",
    // For example, running a custom code generation task
    "codegen": "node ./my-codegen-script.js",
    // For example, using Prisma
    "db:migrate": "prisma db push"
  }
}
```

This means that users of your `dev` task _don't need to worry about codegen or migrating their database_ - it gets handled for them before their development server even starts.

## Running `dev` only in certain workspaces

To run a `dev` task in only certain workspaces, you should use the [`--filter` syntax](/docs/core-concepts/filtering). For example:

```bash
turbo run dev --filter docs
```

Will only run `dev` in the workspace named `docs`.
