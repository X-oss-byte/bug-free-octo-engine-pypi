# Saving time on CI

Running continuous integration servers to lint or deploy your apps can be slow and expensive. Any chance to save CI time can help you build and iterate faster.

## Cancel unnecessary builds

When your app gets deployed from a CI, it usually performs these steps:

1. It [installs your `node_modules`](/docs/handbook/package-installation)
2. It runs `build` on your app
3. It runs `deploy` on the built code - whether that's sending it to the web, app store, or server.

**Install, build, deploy**. Using Turborepo's [caching](/docs/core-concepts/caching), we can save time on the build step.

But Turborepo doesn't cache your `node_modules` or deploy your application - so how can we save time on steps 1 and 3?
