# Getting Started with Turborepo

Turborepo is a blazing fast build system for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos: codebases containing multiple projects, often using multiple frameworks, in a single, unified code repository. Turborepo leverages advanced build system ideas and techniques to speed up development, without the configuration and complexity. Unlike other build systems, Turborepo is designed to be incrementally adopted, so you can gradually and partially add it to most codebases in a few minutes.

## Examples

You can also clone a Turborepo starter repository to get a head start on your monorepo. For even more examples and starters, see the [Turborepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples).
