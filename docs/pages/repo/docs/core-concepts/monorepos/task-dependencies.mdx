# Task Dependencies

Turborepo is most powerful when you express how your tasks relate to each other.
We refer to these relationships as "dependencies", but they are not the same as
package dependencies that you install from your `package.json` files. While Turborepo
does understand your workspaces, it does not automatically draw any
relationships between their tasks, unless you express them in `turbo.json` via
the `dependsOn` configuration.

Let's walk through some common patterns on how to make a task depend on other tasks.

## From the same workspace

There might be tasks that need to run _before_ other tasks. For instance,
`build` might need to be run before `deploy`.

If both tasks are in the same workspace, you can specify the relationship like
this:

```jsonc filename="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {},
    "deploy": {
      // A workspace's `deploy` task depends on the `build` task of the same workspace.
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

This means that whenever `turbo deploy` is run, `build` will also be run
inside the same workspace.

## From dependent workspaces

A common pattern in monorepos is to declare that a workspace's `build` task
should only run once the `build` tasks of all _the workspaces it depends on_ are
complete.

<Callout type="info">
This can be confusing as it refers to both _workspace_ dependencies
and _task_ dependencies, which are different concepts. Workspace dependencies are `dependencies`
and `devDependencies` in `package.json`, whereas, task dependencies are `dependsOn` key in `turbo.json`.
</Callout>

The `^` symbol (called a "caret") explicitly declares that the task depends on the task in a
workspace it depends on.

```jsonc filename="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      // A workspace's `build` command depends on its dependencies'
      // and devDependencies' `build` commands being completed first
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
    }
  }
}
```

With the configuration above, if an app installs a package from another workspace, the package's
`build` script will always run before the app's `build` script.

## From arbitrary workspaces

Sometimes, you may want a workspace-task to depend on another
workspace-task. This can be especially helpful for repos migrating from `lerna`
or `rush`, where tasks are run in separate phases by default. Sometimes these
configurations make assumptions that cannot be expressed in a simple `pipeline`
configuration, as seen above. Or you may just want to express sequences of tasks
between applications or microservices when using `turbo` in CI/CD.

For these cases, you can express these relationships in your `pipeline`
configuration using the `<workspace>#<task>` syntax. The example below describes
the `deploy` script of a `frontend` application that depends on the `deploy` and
`health-check` scripts of `backend`, as well as the `test` script of a `ui`
workspace:

```jsonc filename="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // Explicit workspace-task to workspace-task dependency
    "frontend#deploy": {
      "dependsOn": ["ui#test", "backend#deploy", "backend#health-check"]
    }
  }
}
```

This explicit configuration for `frontend#deploy` may seem to conflict with the
`test` and `deploy` task configurations, but it does not. Since `test` and
`deploy` do not have dependencies on other workspaces (e.g. `^<task>`), they can
execute any time after their workspace's `build` and `test` scripts have
finished.

<Callout>
  Notes:

1. Although this `<workspace>#<task>` syntax is a useful escape hatch, we
   generally recommend using it for deployment orchestration tasks such as
   health checks, rather than build-time dependencies, so that Turborepo can
   optimize these tasks more efficiently
1. Workspace-tasks do not inherit cache configuration. You must redeclare
   [`outputs`](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#outputs) at the moment.
1. `<workspace>` must match the `name` key in the workspace's `package.json` or
   the task will be ignored.

</Callout>

## Dependencies outside of a task

When your task has topological dependencies that are outside of that given task,
you'll still want to enjoy the parallelism of Turborepo and ensure that your
caching behavior is reflects code changes.

To demonstrate how to do this, let's say you have a set of packages (modeled as
workspaces in your codebase) to define some math functions: `add`, `subtract`, and
`multiply`. `subtract` is implemented by calling `add` with a negative number
and your `multiply` works by calling `add` in a loop. So, `add` is a dependency
of both `subtract` and `multiply`.

```bash
packages/
  add/package.json      # does not depend on anything
  multiply/package.json # depends on add
  subtract/package.json # depends on add
turbo.json
package.json
```

You've written tests in all three of these workspaces and it's time to run them.
There are two requirements here:

1. All tests run in parallel to keep things speedy
2. A change in a dependency should result in a cache miss

To accomplish this, we can set up a pipeline like this:

```jsonc filename="turbo.json"
{
   "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
   "pipeline": {
     "topo": {
       "dependsOn": ["^topo"]
     },
     "test": {
       "dependsOn": ["^topo"]
     }
   }
 }
```

![](/images/docs/task-graph-with-placeholder-task.png)

In this pipeline, we declare a "synthetic" task called `topo`. Since we don't
have a `topo` script in any of our `package.json` files, on `turbo test` the
pipeline will go straight to running `test` scripts in parallel, meeting our first requirement.

But this `topo` task also creates a "synthetic" workspace-task dependency from `multiple` -> `add`,
and from `subtract` -> `add`. This means that when you change code in `add`, you will also get
a cache miss for the workspaces in `multiply` and `subtract`, meeting the second requirement.

## No dependencies

An empty dependency list (`dependsOn` is either undefined or `[]`) means that
nothing needs to run before this task! After all, it has no dependencies.

```jsonc filename="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // A workspace's `lint` command has no dependencies and can be run any time.
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```
