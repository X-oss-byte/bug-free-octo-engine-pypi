# Turbrepo Codemods

Turbrepo provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your Turbrepo codebase when a feature is deprecated.

Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase programmatically. This allows for a large amount of changes to be applied without having to manually go through every file.
